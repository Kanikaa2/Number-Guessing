A guessing game is a classic and fun way to engage users and challenge their guessing skills. Through this, we will create a simple guessing game using Python. 
This game will randomly generate a number, and the user will have to guess the number within a certain range. 
This is going to be a simple guessing game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 to 10, and the user has to guess it in 3 attempts.
Based on the user’s guess computer will give various hints if the number is high or low. When the user’s guess matches the number computer will print the answer along with the number of attempts.
